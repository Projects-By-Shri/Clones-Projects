01. Create frontend (tailwind setup){
    npm i slick-carousel react-slick react-toastify react-router react-router-dom react-redux react-icons apexcharts react-apexcharts moment flowbite axios @reduxjs/toolkit @paypal/react-paypal-js
}
02. npm init --i 
npm i nodemon multer mongoose jsonwebtoken express-formidable express-async-handler express dotenv cors cookie-parser concurrently bcryptjs

03. Create Backend(node and many setup)
04. Delete public,inside src deleted assets , app.css , index.css

05. app.jsx and change everything to our scratch.
06. change scripts:
 "scripts": {
    "backend": "nodemon backend/index.js",
    "frontend": "npm run dev --prefix frontend",
    "dev":"concurrently \"npm run frontend\" \"npm run backend\""
  },

07. try and run them:
08. backend files.
09. add db.js and config it and more to .env
10. installing and using different packages and utils in index.js

11. Done with the setup that we need to do ......every code is going to run via main.jsx for frontend...that we need to add in app.jsx....all the files must be executed through main only.

12. for backend we have separated code as we could see and it will run as well...that main is we have used mongoose in the backend we just goes in config file....all the required file are important in backend and frontend........frontend code runs from src folder...and we will go in more depth...backend code runs via index.js where will be using express and mongoose as our backend part...tailwind in frontend is what wil use and could use many different things as well...currently will be working via js and soon will go on ts.
